### Simulation of mechanical Random Walk device

Simulation of Random Walk system of particles in Galton Board Random Walker.
you can see the physical device and how it works in this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xUBhhM4vbM).

The whole simulation is based on running a particle from the initial location and calculating the forces and accelerations at each time step and letting it fall and collide until reaches the end of the device. And of course, repeating it to get enough samples.

I represented this simulation as the term project of the analytical mechanic course a long time ago when I was a beginner. These codes had been written in a very amateur and terrible way and I don't recommend hurting your eyes by looking at them.
